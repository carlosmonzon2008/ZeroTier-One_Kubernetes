# ZeroTier-One_Kubernetes
## This is an example deployment of ZeroTier One on Kubernetes.

### How to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster, from a terminal that has "kubectl" configured with that cluster.
```console
user@computer:~$ kubectl apply -f ZeroTier_Kubernetes_Deploy.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/zerotier created
configmap/zerotier-networks created
deployment.apps/zerotier created
```

> ### - In this example I use a ConfigMap to store the \<`network ID`\>, which in case of being more than one must be separated by space. I have also commented the option of a Secret. In case you want to use the Secret is only to comment the ConfigMap part and uncomment the Secret part, and also comment the "configMapKeyRef" block and uncomment the "secretKeyRef" block inside the Deployment.

> In case of using the ConfigMap.
```yaml
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: zerotier-networks
  labels:
    app: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/component: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/name: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: zerotier
data:
  NETWORK_IDS: 0123456789abcdef
```
`Replace the value of NETWORK_IDS with the ID(s) of your ZeroTier network(s).`

> In case of using the Secret.
```yaml
---
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: zerotier-networks
  labels:
    app: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/component: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/name: zerotier
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: zerotier
data:
  NETWORK_IDS: MDEyMzQ1Njc4OWFiY2RlZg==
type: Opaque
```
`Replace the NETWORK_IDS value with the ID(s) of your ZeroTier network(s), base 64 encoded.`

> Example of how to encode in base64 from a Linux terminal.
```console
user@computer:~$ printf 0123456789abcdef | base64
MDEyMzQ1Njc4OWFiY2RlZg==
```


> ### -It is important to keep in mind that for this deployment to work correctly, you must have administrator permissions in the Kubernetes cluster, or at least the necessary permissions to be able to assign "privileged=true" in the container's securityContext, in addition to the "NET_ADMIN" and "SYS_ADMIN" capabilities.
```yaml
---
kind: Deployment
.
.
.
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
            capabilities:
              add:
              - NET_ADMIN
              - SYS_ADMIN
.
.
.
```

> ### - In the Deployment, the block that is enclosed by `##-----------------------------------------------------Optional-----------------------------------------------------`, is to include a "hello world" made with an NGINX container custom image, that when doing a cURL to the IP of the POD from another member peer within the same ZeroTier network, it responds with this:
```console
c:\>curl 10.144.200.248
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello, ZeroTier!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Hello, ZeroTier!</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```
`The IP "10.144.200.248" is the IP that was assigned to my POD by my ZeroTier network in my tests. The IP in your case may be different. In this example the cURL was done from a Windows machine connected to the same ZeroTier network of this POD.`

> ### - This is an example of the command to to view the logs from the container "kubernetes-zerotier" inside of the POD.
```console
user@computer:~$ kubectl logs -f -l "app=zerotier,deployment=zerotier" -c kubernetes-zerotier
=> Configuring networks to join
=> Joining networks: [0123456789abcdef]
===> Configuring join: [0123456789abcdef]
=> Starting ZeroTier
===> ZeroTier hasn't started, waiting a second
=> Writing healthcheck for networks: [0123456789abcdef]
=> zerotier-cli info: [200 info 72103ab4e8 1.10.2 OFFLINE]
=> Sleeping infinitely
```
`Although at startup it indicates OFFLINE, after this member's access is approved within the ZeroTier Web portal (https://my.zerotier.com/network/), when accessing within the POD and executing the command "zerotier-cli info" it will appear ONLINE.`

> ### - Commands for getting inside the POD to check the connection status and view the assigned IP address from ZeroTier network.
```console
user@computer:~$ kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l "app=zerotier,deployment=zerotier" -o name) -c kubernetes-zerotier -- /bin/bash

```
`Here you can see the network interface that ZeroTier adds to the POD, which in this test is "ztc12bw2fe", and the associated IP "10.144.200.248/16", which is a range belonging to the ZeroTier network to which the POD has joined.`

> ### - The PersistentVolumeClaim is optional, and is set to maintain the configuration of the deployed POD, so that in case the POD is destroyed and a new one is deployed, this new POD will connect to the ZeroTier network using the same configuration as before. That way it is not added as a new member within the network. The ZeroTier One service keeps its configuration and state information in its working directory. Itâ€™s found by default at the following location `/var/lib/zerotier-one`. This is where the Persistent Volume is mounted.
